### Pizza Ordering App

Project Subject: Pizza Order

Your team is tasked with creating an application to assist with ordering a pizza. 

You are to create a program that asks the user for their pizza order and calculates their order total. 

This project can be done in any language and can either be command-line based or be a web app. 

You must include all of the toppings below and also ask the user for their preferred size. 

You can decide your own pricing scale, but each selection must update the cart in a consistent manner.
